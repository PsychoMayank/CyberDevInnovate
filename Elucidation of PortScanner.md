Objective:
The Python script serves as a port scanner, detecting open ports on a specified IP address.

Features:

ASCII Art Banner:
The script displays an eye-catching “PORT SCANNER” banner using ASCII art.

Port Scanning Logic:
It systematically scans common ports (1 to 99) using the socket library.
When a successful connection occurs, it identifies open ports.

Exception Handling:
The script gracefully handles keyboard interruptions, hostname resolution issues, and unresponsive servers.

Usage:
Run the script with an IP address argument (e.g., python portscanner.py <IP address>).

Why ASCII Art?
ASCII art enhances visual appeal and provides a professional touch.
